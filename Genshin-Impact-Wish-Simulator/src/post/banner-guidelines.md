As I expected, after a period of monitoring Custom Banner features, I found that a lot of users shared inappropriate content through this feature. Therefore, I made some adjustments and provided some rules below to maintain the quality of custom banners:

### Prohibited Content:

By using this feature, you agree to refrain from sharing any content that is inappropriate, offensive, or illegal. This includes, but is not limited to, explicit nudity, sexually explicit material, real and explicit photos, harassment, political content, and any materials that violate applicable laws and regulations.
If you persist in violating these rules, I will take actions such as blocking your banner or other appropriate actions.

### Recommendation:

1. Avoid using real photos; I suggest opting for artwork created by an artist or your original creations.
2. Better to use transparent images whenever possible; both PNG and Webp formats are acceptable.
3. Better to use different images beetween the Splash-Art Image and Face Image
4. For the Face Image, it is recommended to use close-up image.
5. Please ensure all fields are filled with relevant and appropriate text.

<!-- If you choose to share your banner publicly and adhere to these recommendations, there is a possibility that your banner may be featured on this site through a page that I am currently preparing. -->

### Data Storage and Privacy:

Each banner you create is securely stored in your browser's local memory. At **WishSimulator.App**, I try to prioritize your privacy, and I want to assure you that I neither collect nor store your banner data in cloud storage unless you choose to click the Share Button explicitly.

It's important to note that in the event of an unforeseen incident on your device, leading to the clearing of your browser's storage, all the data associated with your banners will be lost. Consequently, you will be unable to edit any banners previously created. I recommend exercising caution and regularly backing up your data to prevent any inadvertent loss

Every Custom Banner Unit stored in cloud storage will be automatically deleted after 30 days of inactivity. However, the Banner Unit will still be stored in your device's memory, so when your banner has passed the 30-day mark without activity, you just need to republish your banner.
